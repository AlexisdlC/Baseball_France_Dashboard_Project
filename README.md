# Introduction

⚾ The goal of this project is to build a global baseball data dashboard using Power BI, and relying on data stored in a database built in SQL and updated semi-automatically using a python script. 

🐍 The data used in this project was obtained using the [PyBaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/tree/master/pybaseball) and the [MLB Stats API](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI/issues) packages in python. The data is not stored in intermediate .csv files ; it is pulled, pre-transformed and directly inserted in the SQL databse using the SQLAlechemy toolkit.

🌎 The project contains all MLB data, here for the 2025 regular season, but it can easily be adapted to collect and update as the 2026 season goes, for example. The dashboard is kept mostly in French, since the goal is to provide visuals and a platform for French baseball content creators to have access to polished statistics to share with their communities, tailored to the team they follow.

# Background

🏟️ Passionate about data, baseball and especially about the Yankees, I wanted to take the opportunity to join my two passions and use baseball statistics to practice and train my skills in building a proper data pipeline. This project expands on two other projects: [Yankees Overall Data Project](https://github.com/AlexisdlC/SQL_Yankees_Data/tree/main) and [Yankees Pitch Data Project](https://github.com/AlexisdlC/SQL_Yankees_Pitch_Statcast_Data/tree/main)  which focused on global statistics of Yankee players in Yankee games. With this project, I wanted to expand to larger datasets, for which pitch-by-pitch data is perfect.

### My main goals with this project:

* Build a database gathering pitch by pitch data from Yankees' batters and Yankees' pitchers perspective. 📊
* Build interactive dashboards to explore different aspects of the data. 📉
* Share my work with others.
* Develop my skills in data analytics tools, using larger datasets and build best practice habits.
